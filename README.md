This is portfolio for CSE310 Apply Programming submission

# Overview

This programming is an informative website for Japanese potential students in React. The concept is to manage and organize code by using reusable atom and pages. And the hook and useState can make the website less code and lower loading.

This is the programmings which I made
1. Informative web site in React, there are links for BYUI actual resources
2. Organize atom design which allow me to code faster and consistently. 

3. use hooks and useState which makes website dynamic change without loading.

The reason to make this site is that people can check my programming skills and easy to arrange how to display the files.
